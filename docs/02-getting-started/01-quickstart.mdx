First, explore the options Sequence offers you and your players or users. 
Sequence’s wallets are the gold standard in balancing ease of onboarding, security, and flexibility for consumers. Read more about why 
smart wallets built on non-custodial basics are vital for creating the best web3 experiences. 
The Sequence Universal Wallet is the world’s best wallet for navigating the open blockchain-based ecosystem. With wallet creation in 2 
steps, a consumer-friendly UI, and support for all web3 transactions, the Sequence Wallet. Unlike other wallets, however, developers 
and brands can still allow for gasless, efficient, and batched transactions. 
Sequence’s Wallet as a Service technology lets developers create fully seamless and embedded onboarding and account creation 
experiences, natively in-game or in-app. No add-ons, no pop-ups, no user transaction signing. 
The new SequenceKit is a revolutionary new wallet connect and creation modal that  lets developers serve users with the best of both 
worlds: connecting existing web3 wallets easily, or seamlessly creating a new Sequence wallet with an email or social login. In 
addition, SequenceKit embeds the experience directly in your game or app, and can show users’ items, let them send or receive items, 
and do NFT checkout with fiat or credit card, all from within the game, regardless of which wallet they’re using. No pop-ups or add-
ons required. 
All Sequence wallets integrate our Indexer, Relayer, and Node Gateway for easy purchasing and transactions, real-time data, and more. 

# Quick Start

Get started with Sequence with just a few lines of code, follow along below. 
 
## Install

First, install the [0xsequence](https://www.npmjs.com/package/0xsequence) and [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) packages from NPM:

```sh
npm install 0xsequence ethers
```
or

```sh
pnpm install 0xsequence ethers
```
or

```sh
yarn add 0xsequence ethers
```

You can find the source of the `0xsequence` package on [Github](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js).


## Connect your wallet

**Connecting to Ethereum Mainnet:**

```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

const wallet = await sequence.initWallet({ defaultNetwork: 'mainnet' })
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect(({ app: 'Your app name' }))

console.log('=> connected?', connectDetails.connected)
```

**Connecting to Polygon:**
```ts
import { sequence } from '0xsequence'

const wallet = await sequence.initWallet({ defaultNetwork: 'polygon' })
const connectDetails = await wallet.connect(({ app: 'Your app name' }))

console.log('=> connected?', connectDetails.connected)
```

:::info Required fields
`defaultNetwork` is optional, the wallet can always be used to interact with any supported network by using the `getProvider('<network>')` and `getSigner(<network>)` methods.

`app` during connect is **always** required, this is the name of your dapp, and will be shown to the user when they are asked to connect their wallet.
:::

## Get the wallet address

Once connected to the wallet, you can get the wallet address:

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()
const walletAddress = wallet.getAddress()

console.log(walletAddress)
// # => '0xabcd....'
```

Trying to get the wallet address before the wallet is connected will throw an error.

## Open the wallet from your dapp

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()
wallet.openWallet()
```

## Get the blockchain network ID

You can use a variety of methods to query the chain ID which the wallet is presently
connected to.

```ts
const wallet = sequence.getWallet()

console.log('chainId:', await wallet.getChainId())

const provider = wallet.getProvider()
console.log('provider.getChainId()', await provider.getChainId())

const signer = wallet.getSigner()
console.log('signer.getChainId()', await signer.getChainId())
```
